Datero - VisualPinMAME Seed
===============================

Datero is a WIP Python command line tool to download and organize your Dat Roms.
As today the tool supports dat-omatic, redump, and translated-english dats.
It merges all the dats in a tree folder structure thought to use with Emulators rather than dats.
The dat structure is compatible with `ROMVault <https://www.romvault.com/>`__.

VisualPinMAME Seed is a plugin for Datero that downloads and organizes your VisualPinMAME dat file.


Installation
------------

Download the code and install requirements (recommended to use a virtual environment)
